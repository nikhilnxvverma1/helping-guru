# Short:
Hackathon > 24 hours > Simple Idea > Project Management for beginners > Completion Status : backend = 90% , frontend = 40%

# Long:
I sat in a bus, that took me to Binghampton University where I paired up with a guy in hopes of winning a hackathon at which we failed, but ended up learning a lot about technology anyway.

## Idea
Helping Guru is a social platform that helps beginner developers in their projects by attaching
mentors to it. The idea revolves around focusing on providing a more contextual knowledge to the user and not
a generic answer as found in more Q/A websites. Mentors are peer users in the site that would volunteer to help,
those in need.

This project started as a hackathon idea and still in development phase. Most of the backend work is done. Whats left are some
frontend screens and integration. I will only work on this project if someone thinks this is a **good idea**.
