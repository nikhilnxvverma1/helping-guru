# Short:
Hackathon > 24 hours > Simple Idea > Project Management for beginners > Completion Status : backend = 90% , frontend = 40%

# Long:
For a hackathon event taking place at Binghampton University, I ideated working on a webapp which pairs novice programmers to expert ones.We managed to complete a major portion of the backend but we could'nt finish on time.  Nevertheless, we learned a lot.

## Idea
Helping Guru is a social platform that helps beginner developers in their projects by attaching
mentors to it. The idea revolves around focusing on providing a more contextual knowledge to the user and not
a generic answer as found in more Q/A websites. Mentors are peer users in the site that would volunteer to help,
those in need.
