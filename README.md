# Helping Guru
Helping Guru is a social platform that helps beginner developers in their projects by attaching
mentors to it. The idea revolves around focusing on providing a more contextual knowledge to the user and not
a generic answer as found in more Q/A websites. Mentors are peer users in the site that would volunteer to help,
those in need.
